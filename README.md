According to recent studies, spam emails account for over 50% of all email traffic, with millions of spam emails being sent every day. These emails not only clutter inboxes, but also pose significant threats to individuals and businesses, including phishing attacks, malware infections, and data breaches. In fact, it is estimated that spam emails cost businesses billions of dollars each year in lost productivity and security breaches. With the increasing sophistication of spammers and cybercriminals, it is becoming more important than ever to have effective spam filtering techniques in place to protect against these threats.

A spam filter is an essential tool for managing email in the modern digital age. With the amount of spam email being sent each day, it can be difficult for individuals and businesses to sort through the clutter and find important messages. Spam filters work by using various techniques to identify and block unwanted email, allowing users to focus on the messages that matter. In this project, we propose a spam filter based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By encoding the text of emails using bag of words and word2vec techniques, as well as a pretrained fasttext model, we are able to classify emails as either spam or not spam with high accuracy. We explore various classification techniques and evaluate their performance using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we believe that our spam filter has the potential to provide significant benefits to individuals and businesses alike in the management of their email communications.
